This is an implementation of the "Blocker" game.
It is written entirely in C.
The main libraries used are pthread.h and curses.h

Prerequisites:
1. The GCC compiler (or any C compiler)
2. The development library for libncurses (probably libncurses-dev)
3. A POSIX-compatible system (i.e. Unix, Linux, Mac OS X)

To install everything you need in Mac OS X, you just have to install Xcode and you're ready to go.

To compile this, run the following command:
gcc blockers.c -lpthread -lcurses -o blockers

That will compile the source code and create a 'blockers' executable.
To run the executable, run the following command:
./blockers

And you're playing.

How to play:
Use the left and right arrows to move left and right.
Press 'p' to pause, and then press any key to continue.
Press 'q' to quit.

I've had some issues running this flawlessly under Mac OS X 10.6. The screen keeps getting messy after a while for some reason. I ran it great under Linux though (Ubuntu). I'll try to figure out what is wrong and fix it.

I will keep working on this game from time to time just for fun and as a learning tool where I can experiment with different ideas and libraries.
